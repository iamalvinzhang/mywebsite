<p>Hi I'm Alvin.</p>

<p>I'm currently leading marketing at <a href ="https://thegraniteexpo.com" target="_blank" class="text-gray-400">Granite Expo</a>. We have 8 locations throughout the Bay Area.</p>

<p>I've also worked with two startups, <a href="https://www.aragon.ai/" target="_blank" class="text-orange-400">Aragon AI</a> and <a href="https://hyper.online/" target="_blank" class="text-blue-4000">Hyper Online</a>. 
   One was backed by the YCombinator. The other backed by Neo.
</p>

<p>
I love exploring new ideas and new things. Pitched <a href = "./mcuban" target="_self" class="text-mcuban-400">Mark Cuban</a> a startup idea a while back. We talked a bit and he pointed out a few legal hurdles I would have to overcome.
Learned that securities laws are a pain!
 <br>
</p>

<p>I love design and getting creative but also enjoy working with numbers.</p>





<p>Picture of me coming soon. In the mean time, here's a picture of a squirrel I took.</p>
