<p>Gaming has always been one of my favorite pastimes. What started with Super Mario Bros turned 
    into a lifelong passion for gaming - particularly strategy games. Gaming was a way for me to 
    relax with friends but also a place where I could channel my competitive energy. 
</p>

<p>
    This was true especially when it came to League of Legends. Within 2 years of playing the game
    seriously, I found myself rank 90 out of 28 million players. I started a boosting 
    (playing on another person's account to increase their rank) business soon after. 
</p>
<p>
    This was where I first came across marketing in a real life setting. Originally, I was going to 
    design a boosting website but there were already too many eloboosting websites. Investing in SEO
    for good website placement would not have been worth it. Instead, I advertised on social 
    media platforms - Discord, WeChat and Twitter. 
</p>

<p>
    I've also gotten the opportunity to be a consultant to a few professional Academy and LCS
    League of Legends players as well as a few twitch streamers. Am also a <s>stereotypical</s> 
   twitch moderator for a few channels!
